# 🤖 GENIE AI

GENIE AI is a Flutter-based Voice AI Assistant that answers your questions using ChatGPT and generates images using DALL·E — all through **voice commands** only. Powered by OpenAI API, GENIE AI offers a fully hands-free, intuitive experience combining text-based and image-based AI responses.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ Voice-controlled AI assistant
- 🧠 ChatGPT-powered conversational answers
- 🖼️ DALL·E image generation using voice prompts
- 🔊 Text-to-speech responses
- 💡 Clean and intuitive UI
- ⚡ Built with Flutter for cross-platform support

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Press the **mic button** and speak your query.
2. GENIE AI converts your speech to text using the `speech_to_text` package.
3. If the prompt is a question, it sends it to **ChatGPT**.
4. If the prompt is an image request (e.g., "Generate an image of a cat astronaut"), it calls **DALL·E**.
5. Response is either:
   - Spoken aloud using `flutter_tts`
   - Displayed as an AI-generated image

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **OpenAI API**
- **speech_to_text** for speech recognition
- **flutter_tts** for voice output
- **http** for API communication
